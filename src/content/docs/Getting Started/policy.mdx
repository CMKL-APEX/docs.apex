The **Artificial Intelligence High-Performance Computing Infrastructure (APEX)** was funded by the Science, Research, and Innovation Promotion Fund (TSRI) 
and the Program Management Unit for Competitiveness (PMU-C) during 2019–2020 for research projects. 
After the project period ended, CMKL University took over system management to continue providing support for 
students and faculty in education, student projects, research, and development within CMKL University and the AI ENGINEERING INSTITUTE, up to the present.

Due to the increasing trend and growing demand for AI research and development among students and faculty, combined with limited computing resources, efficient resource management is necessary to maximize utilization and meet user needs. Therefore, computing resources must be allocated based on usage proportions as follows:

|   | Category                  | % |  Key objectives    |
|:-:| :---                     |:-:|       :----      |
| 1 | CMKL University          | 70| Provide support services to students and teachers for teaching and research. |
| 2 | AI ENGINEERING INSTITUTE* | 20| Provide support services for basic AI computation, federated computation research and development, cloud computing, and resource sharing within the AI ​​Engineering Institute. |
| 3 | SME/Startups             |  5| Provide support services to students, SMEs and Stratups in developing products and innovations. |
| 4 | Training and Promotion   |  5| Support human resource development to take care of AI-HPC system development / Promote AI-HPC usage for general users |
