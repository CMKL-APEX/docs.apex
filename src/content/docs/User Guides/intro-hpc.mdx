## Introduction
Hello and welcome to all users to the world of AI-HPC. 
This tutorial will introduce you to the basic working principles of HPC systems and the various limitations of 
what HPC can and cannot do when compared to the normal computer systems we commonly use.

### How Do Regular Computers Work?
- Working principles of regular computers
- input / processing / memory / output
- Related Devices
- Operating Characteristics
- Usage limitations
  - scale up / scale out
  - price / performance

### What is HPC?
- Working principles of HPC
- input / processing / memory / output
- Related Devices
- Operating Characteristics
  - cluster
  - parallel
  - networking / interconnect
  - share storage
  - privileged access management (pam)
- Usage limitations
  - scale up / scale out
  - price / performance

### HPC + AI = AI-HPC
- AI Applications
- Types according to usage characteristics
  - data processing
  - model training
  - model inferrencing
- Differences from normal HPC
  - Design specifically focused on AI
  - GPGPU (Nvidia / AMD / Intel / other card)
