## Slurm Workload Manager
SLURM (Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management) is open-source software responsible for managing access to resources in a cluster.
It uses a job system for allocation. Initially, users must create Jobs/Tasks by specifying the resources they need, then submit them to the system.
SLURM manages the Jobs/Tasks from queuing in the system, processing, and monitoring the work until the process is complete. 
Additionally, SLURM ensures that:
- Jobs/Tasks are distributed throughout the cluster
- Resources such as processors, memory, and even specialized hardware like GPUs are appropriately allocatedc
- Supports operations and can scale according to available resources
