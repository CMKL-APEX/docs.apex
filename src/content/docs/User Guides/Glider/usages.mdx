It will show all the tasks that belong to this project and resources that have been allocated to this project.

## Task

There are currently 2 templates available on Apex.

1. `Code Server`: Which is a VSCode on a web browser. This is recommended for general tasks.
2. `NeMo`: Those who want to use the [NeMo](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/products/nemo/) can use this template to run a NeMo stack with a VSCode interface.

### Create Task

All the `tasks` are belong to a Project. Users can create `task` with a GPU by click the create task menu and select the template.


After create a task, it will show a `Pending` status while it is being create. After finished, it will change to `Running` status and user can click `Open` to access the task.


> If you stop the Task, currently it won't be able to restart it.


### Volume

We support volume for persistent storage. Volumes are project-scoped, so every tasks in the project can mount volume to it.


### Policy

- Glider is still under development, if you encounter any issues on Glider please contact out support team (apex@cmkl.ac.th).
- We do not have any SLAs for Glider, please backup your data regulary
- Your task might be terminated by our system-admin, any files or scripts that want to be persistent, please use the dedicated volume.
- You may encounter a `Pending` state due to our system resources limitation, if your tasks are critical please contact our admin.

### Known issues

- Glider Task cannot run any superuser commands (sudo)
- Glider is running in containers, so if your projects require a virtual machine support, please contact our support.
- Some library/framework uses total CPUs of system as default value, in this case, it will cause a CPU throttle on your container.
