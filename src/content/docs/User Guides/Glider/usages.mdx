All the `tasks` are belong to a Project. Users can create `task` with a GPU by click the create task menu and select the template.


After create a task, it will show a `Pending` status while it is being create. After finished, it will change to `Running` status and user can click `Open` to access the task.


> If you stop the Task, currently it won't be able to restart it.
