## Getting Started with Glider Task

Glider task (CodeServer) is mostly an empty container, some packages might need to be installed manually.

### Install UV

UV is an extremely fast Python package and project manager, like `pip`.

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

source $HOME/.local/bin/env
```

To create new environment for your project

```bash
mkdir sample-project
cd sample-project

uv venv --seed --python=3.12
```

Then activate your environment
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Now you can install any packages you want.

```bash
uv pip install torch
```
